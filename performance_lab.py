# üîç Problem 1: Find Most Frequent Element
# Given a list of integers, return the value that appears most frequently.
# If there's a tie, return any of the most frequent.
#
# Example:
# Input: [1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1, 3]
# Output: 3

Time and Space Analysis for problem 1:
- Best-case: O(n); must scan all numbers at least once.
- Worst-case: O(n); same as best, we still process all numbers.
- Average-case: O(n).
- Space complexity: O(k), where k is number of unique elements.
- Why this approach? Efficient dictionary counting allows single-pass tracking.
- Could it be optimized? No major optimization; dictionary counting is optimal here.

# üîç Problem 4: Simulate List Resizing (Amortized Cost)
# Create a function that adds n elements to a list that has a fixed initial capacity.

Time and Space Analysis for problem 4:
- When do resizes happen? When list size == capacity.
- What is the worst-case for a single append? O(n); when resizing occurs and items are copied.
- What is the amortized time per append overall? O(1).
- Space complexity: O(n).
- Why does doubling reduce the cost overall? Because resizes happen less frequently as size grows, so average cost per append stays constant.
